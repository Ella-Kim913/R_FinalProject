# AA-3 Project

## Project Overview
Our project investigates the dynamics of food insecurity and welfare services by exploring the relationship between SNAP participation and healthcare coverage across the United States. Additionally, we hope to find out more about what the demographics of these populations are, how the demand for food assistance (SNAP) has changed over the years, and whether political standing plays a role in access to public assistance programs.

## Target Audience
This research primarily targets policymakers, government representatives, and healthcare professionals. We aim to provide insights into SNAP's role and its connection to healthcare, advocating for a holistic view of public well-being in policy decisions.

## Methodology
We analyzed state-level data from multiple sources, including the USDA Food & Nutrition Service and the U.S. Census Bureau, covering the years 2017-2022. Our focus was on public healthcare coverage in relation to SNAP participation, in addition to considering demographic and political factors.

## Key Findings and Figure
This take-away figure shows on average across all the states in the U.S. what percentage of people participate in SNAP and what percentage has public healthcare coverage. Through our individual research questions, we sought to understand more about how the percentages vary throughout the states and possible influences and demographic factors in this variation. 

Our analysis reveals a complex relationship between SNAP participation and healthcare coverage. The findings highlight disparities in access to public welfare programs across states, and an inconsistent correlation between the two variables (SNAP + healthcare). 
Further analysis revealed that Blue states have a higher median and tighter distribution for both SNAP and healthcare coverage compared to Red states. It was also observed that the White population is the predominant participant in SNAP across most states, except for some states in the southern region.

## Conclusion
Our findings call for more nuanced research and policy interventions, emphasizing the need for equitable access to essential services like healthcare and food assistance. The relationship between healthcare coverage and SNAP participation indicates broader socioeconomic and political dynamics that warrant further exploration.
