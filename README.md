# Project Overview

## Introduction
Our project investigates the relationship between SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) participation and healthcare coverage across U.S. states. The primary aim is to understand the dynamics of food insecurity and its impact on health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations.

## Target Audience
This research is primarily aimed at policymakers, government representatives, and healthcare professionals. Our goal is to provide insightful data on the role of SNAP and its connection to healthcare, thereby advocating for a more holistic approach to public well-being in policy decisions.

## Methodology
In our study, we analyzed state-level data from multiple sources, including the USDA Food & Nutrition Service and the U.S. Census Bureau, covering the years 2017-2022. The focus of our analysis was on public healthcare coverage in relation to SNAP participation, while also considering demographic and political factors.

## Key Findings and Figure
Our analysis unveils a complex relationship between SNAP participation and healthcare coverage. The findings underscore disparities across states, with an inconsistent correlation between these factors. A notable bar plot from our presentation visually illustrates these state-by-state variations, highlighting the intricate interplay of socioeconomic and political dynamics.

## Conclusion
Our findings call for more nuanced research and policy interventions, emphasizing the need for equitable access to essential services like healthcare and food assistance. The relationship between healthcare coverage and SNAP participation is indicative of broader socioeconomic and political dynamics that warrant further exploration.
