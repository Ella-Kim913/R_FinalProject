**Research Question**

### Do states with the highest SNAP participation also reflect the highest healthcare coverage?

```{r}
#I took the average of Total(population) for each state across the years to calculate the Average Population for each state. Then I added it to a new dataframe named SNAP_healthcare.
SNAP_healthcare <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%

```

```{r}
#I took the average of SNAP Persons Participation for each state across the years. Then divided that by the Average Population to get the percentage of average SNAP participation for each state.
SNAP_participation <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(Average_SNAP_Persons = mean(`SNAP Persons Participation`))

SNAP_healthcare <- left_join(SNAP_healthcare, SNAP_participation, by = "State")

SNAP_healthcare$snap_participation_percent <- (SNAP_healthcare$Average_SNAP_Persons / SNAP_healthcare$`Average Population`) * 100

head(SNAP_healthcare)
```

#Calculating the percentage of healthcare coverage for each state, and then computing the average healthcare coverage across all the years.

**Main Question**\
Does being a primarily red or blue state affect SNAP Cost and healthcare coverage?

It's widely believed that blue states allocate more funds to public policies like healthcare and SNAP. This analysis aims to verify whether this belief holds for healthcare coverage and SNAP expenses, with the intention of providing policymakers and other stakeholders with data-driven recommendations based on our findings.

\
In the context of the most recent presidential election in the United States, states are often classified as "Red" or "Blue" based on the predominant voting preference for the Republican or Democratic party, respectively.

\<Red States (Republican - Donald Trump)\>

Alabama,Alaska,Arkansas,Florida,Idaho,Indiana,Iowa,Kansas,Kentucky,Louisiana,Mississippi,Missouri,Montana,Nebraska,North Carolina,North Dakota,Ohio,Oklahoma,South Carolina,South Dakota,Tennessee,Texas,Utah,West Virginia,Wyoming

\<Blue States (Democratic - Joe Biden)\>

Arizona,California,Colorado,Connecticut,Delaware,District of Columbia,Georgia,Hawaii,Illinois,Maine,Maryland ,Massachusetts,Michigan,Minnesota,Nevada,New Hampshire,New Jersey,New Mexico,New York,Oregon,Pennsylvania,Rhode Island,Vermont,Virginia,Washington,Wisconsin

Additionally, my analysis is centered on state-level comparisons. To facilitate this, I computed the average values for key variables: health insurance coverage, and SNAP Cost Per Person. Considering the varying population sizes across states, I also calculated the ratio of healthcare insurance coverage to provide a more balanced comparison.

```{r echo=FALSE}
red_states <- c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arkansas", "Florida", "Idaho", "Indiana", 
                "Iowa", "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Mississippi", "Missouri", 
                "Montana", "Nebraska", "North Carolina", "North Dakota", "Ohio", 
                "Oklahoma", "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas", 
                "Utah", "West Virginia", "Wyoming")

blue_states <- c("Arizona", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware", 
                 "District of Columbia", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Illinois", "Maine", 
                 "Maryland", "Massachusetts", "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Nevada", 
                 "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New Mexico", "New York", "Oregon", 
                 "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island", "Vermont", "Virginia", "Washington", 
                 "Wisconsin")


merged_data_Ella <- merged_data %>%
  select(State, Year, `Total`, `With public health coverage`,  `SNAP Cost Per Persons`, `SNAP Cost Per Household`) %>%
  mutate(healthcarecover_ratio = `With public health coverage` / `Total`,
         state_politic = case_when(
           State %in% red_states ~ "Red",
           State %in% blue_states ~ "Blue",
           TRUE ~ "Other" 
         )) %>%
  group_by(State, state_politic) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Healthcare_Cover_Ratio = mean(healthcarecover_ratio, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_SNAP_Cost_Per_Person = mean(`SNAP Cost Per Persons`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_SNAP_Cost_Per_Household = mean(`SNAP Cost Per Household`),
    .groups = "drop" 
  )

head(merged_data_Ella,5)

```

Firstly, an analysis is conducted to compare the average healthcare coverage ratio with the average SNAP cost per person, grouped by whether states are predominantly Red or Blue.

Upon examining the initial plot, it becomes evident that certain outlier values obscure the underlying trends within the data. To obtain a clearer view of the patterns, the dataset will be refined by excluding entries where the average SNAP cost per person exceeds 200.\

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Reshape the data for plotting
long_data <- merged_data_Ella %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Mean_Healthcare_Cover_Ratio", "Mean_SNAP_Cost_Per_Person"),
               names_to = "Metric", values_to = "Value")

# Create the boxplot
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = state_politic, y = Value, fill = state_politic)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Metric, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Healthcare Coverage and SNAP Cost Per Person by State Politics", x= "", y="") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Red" = "red", "Blue" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()


```

Once the outliers, specifically Alaska and Hawaii, were excluded, the data pattern became more discernible.

\
**Healthcare Coverage Ratio:** Blue states appear to have a higher median healthcare coverage ratio than Red states. The data for Blue states is more tightly clustered, indicating less variation in healthcare coverage ratios within these states. Red states show more variability, indicating some Red states with significantly lower healthcare coverage ratios.

**SNAP Cost Per Person:** The median SNAP cost per person is roughly the same for both Blue and Red states, but the range is broader for Red states, suggesting a greater disparity in SNAP costs within these states.

Although the average differences are not statistically significant, still there is a gap between the blue and red states, and even the distribution indicates some disparities. Blue states typically have higher healthcare coverage and SNAP expenditures per person than red states, suggesting that a state's political leanings may influence policies related to fundamental needs like food and healthcare. While our analysis did not employ extensive statistical methods and political affiliation is not the sole determining factor, these findings provide a useful perspective for state policymakers to consider.

```{r echo=FALSE}


# Filter the data to include only SNAP cost per person under $200
filtered_data <- merged_data_Ella %>%
  filter(Mean_SNAP_Cost_Per_Person < 200)

# Reshape the data for plotting
long_data <- filtered_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Mean_Healthcare_Cover_Ratio", "Mean_SNAP_Cost_Per_Person"),
               names_to = "Metric", values_to = "Value")

# Create the boxplot
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = state_politic, y = Value, fill = state_politic)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Metric, scales = "free_y", labeller = as_labeller(c(Mean_Healthcare_Cover_Ratio = "Healthcare Coverage (%)", Mean_SNAP_Cost_Per_Person = "SNAP Cost per Person ($)"))) +
  labs(title = "Healthcare Coverage and SNAP Cost Per Person by State Politics", x= "", y="") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Red" = "red", "Blue" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()
