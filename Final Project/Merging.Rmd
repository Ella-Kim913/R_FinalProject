Few things to be noted

1. SNAP2022Race, The race is based on the houshold so there are Mixed or "two or more races"\
2. Healthcare coverage : This one has the total healthcare coverage so did not do private/public seperately, just healthcare coverage\
Also did not have 2020 datasets, so its from 2017 to 2022(excluded 2020)\
3. SNAP 5 years from 2019 to 2023\

My concern is 1) if we marge based on the states, the year wont perfectly match since one of them are 2017-2022, the other is 2019-2023\
2) Also SNAP2022Race data, I dont know how to merge with other two datasets since it only contains 2022 data\

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

SNAP2022Race <- read_delim("../Datasets/SNAP_Race_2022.csv")
SNAP2022Race

Healthcare <- read_delim("../Datasets/Healthcare_Total.csv")
Healthcare

SNAP5Years <- read_delim("../Datasets/SNAP_5years.csv")
SNAP5Years

Healthcare <- rename(Healthcare, State = `Selected Geographies`)
Healthcare

merged_data <- inner_join(Healthcare, SNAP5Years, by = c("State", "Year"))
head(merged_data,6)


```
